This addon shows a guitar hero like popup with your note streaks

Just add note_streaks.html into OBS as a browser source
It will display the popups as you are playing

If you'd like to preview it, edit script.js and change preview to true at the top of the file
Just remember to change it back to false before using!
And; don't forget to refresh the browser source ;)

NOTE: You will need to enable addons in config/addons.json
